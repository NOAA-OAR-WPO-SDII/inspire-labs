##  Design Process

Our design process is driven by the needs of social scientists working with weather and climate data. We're documenting our research and decisions here for transparency and community input.

### ** Coming Soon**
- **User Research Findings** - Interviews with social scientists and data managers

- **Accessibility Guidelines** - Ensuring inclusive design for all researchers

### **Design Principles**
- **Researcher-Centered** - Built for the way social scientists actually work
- **Accessible** - Usable by researchers with diverse abilities and technical skills
- **Transparent** - Clear about data sources, processing, and limitations
- **Collaborative** - Designed for interdisciplinary teams

### **Get Involved**
- [📧 Participate in user research](mailto:kyle.metta@noaa.gov)
- [💭 Share design feedback](https://github.com/inspirelabs/inspire-labs/discussions)
